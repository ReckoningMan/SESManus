# Parts Catalog Scraper

A Python-based web scraping agent for cataloging parts from multiple sources including PartsTree.com, Rotary, and Stens.

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the scraper:
```bash
python parts_catalog_scraper.py
```

## Features

- Scrapes parts information from:
  - PartsTree.com
  - Rotary
  - Stens
- Saves results in JSON format
- Includes logging for monitoring and debugging

## Output

The scraper will generate:

## Note

This is an initial implementation. The specific scraping logic for each website needs to be implemented based on their structure and terms of service.
